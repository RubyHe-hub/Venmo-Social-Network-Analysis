# Venmo-Social-Network-Analysis

Venmo is a peer-to-peer (P2P) mobile payment app owned by PayPal. The Venmo app allows its users to exchange money with just a click of a button. In the fourth quarter of 2019, Venmoâ€™s net payment volume amounted to 29 billion U.S. dollars, representing a 56 percent year-on-year growth, and its user-base had more than 40 million active accounts. What made Venmo so
popular in the US is its social flavor; users are required to accompany their transactions with a message describing what the transaction was about. This social twist has allowed Venmo to transform financial transactions into sharing experiences.

In this project, we used Spark to analyze text&emoji transaction messages from Venmo using Natural Language Processing techniques - Bag-of-words and Stemming to formulate user spending behavior. And we built social network metrics of users and calculated clustering coefficient and page rank of each user using Networkx package. Finally, we predicted customer transactions using RFS (Recency, Frequency, Social network) regression model.
